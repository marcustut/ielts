It is my pleasure to recommend Marcus Lee Kai Yang for admission to _[name of program]_ at _[name of university]_. He was my student from the Cloud Computing course during his undergraduate study at Tunku Abdul Rahman University College. The course comprised of fundamentals of modern cloud technologies with a heavy focus on practical application and assignments. Marcus was the brightest among his peers, often scoring the highest in weekly quizzes. 

Overall, Marcus is a fast learner and he is highly resourceful. His project on scaling web applications on AWS Cloud had demonstrated his unique ability in understading real-world problems with high clarity and that helped him to pinpoint issues accurately as evidented by his work. His dilligence and overall intelligence is also reflected in his grades for the course.
